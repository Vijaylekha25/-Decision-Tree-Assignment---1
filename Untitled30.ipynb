    "\n",
    "Decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by partitioning the feature space into regions and assigning a class label to each region. The algorithm builds a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents a class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, the algorithm starts at the root node and traverses down the tree based on the feature values of the input data, following the decision rules at each node until it reaches a leaf node. The class label associated with the leaf node is then assigned to the input data as the predicted class."

    "\n",
    "The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves recursively partitioning the feature space into regions that are as homogeneous as possible with respect to the target variable (class labels). This is achieved by selecting the best feature to split on at each node based on some criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain. The splitting process continues until certain stopping criteria are met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or no further improvement in purity can be achieved."

    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem, decision tree classifier works by partitioning the feature space into two regions corresponding to the two classes. At each node of the tree, it makes a decision on which feature to split based on a criterion that maximizes the homogeneity of the resulting regions with respect to the class labels. This process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met, resulting in a tree structure where each leaf node represents one of the two classes."

    "\n",
    "Geometrically, decision tree classification can be visualized as partitioning the feature space into axis-aligned rectangles (for simplicity in 2D) or hyper-rectangles (in higher dimensions). Each split in the tree divides the feature space into two regions along one of the feature axes. Predictions are made by determining which region of the feature space the input data point falls into based on the decision rules learned during training."
